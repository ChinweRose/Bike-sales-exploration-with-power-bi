## Sales Analysis for bike product for December 2021

### Project Overview

This analysis aims to provide insights into the sales performance of ABC Bike Company for the month of December 2021. I'll draw out trends, patterns, and conclusions from the data that has been recorded and make valuable decisions that will boost the company's performance.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The data source used for this analysis is the "bike_sales.csv" file containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel - Data cleaning
- Power bi - Creating reports
  

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks;

- Data loading
- Handling missing values
- Data cleaning and formatting


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involves exploring sales data to answer key questions such as;

- What is the overall trend?
- Which countries are top buyers?
- What age group are top buyers?
- Which day has the highest sales?


### Results/Findings 

The analysis results are as follows;
1. The bike sale is known to be in higher demand among the female gender (approximately $230000 sales made) while the male gender has an approximate value of $170000 worth of sales, 
   with a noticeable peak on the 19th of December 2021.
2. Buyers within the age range of 35-64 purchased the bike more with a total of 56% of the overall purchase of bikes.
3. Highest sales were recorded on the 19th of December with a total profit of $31422 and total revenue of $69650, with California topping the list in terms of profits and revenues.


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions;

- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales days to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting the product within the geographical location with the highest sales and profits.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-lifetime value customers effectively, in this case.



### Limitations

I had to remove all the blank spaces from the cost and profit columns because they would affect the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. Even at that, there were still some outliers, but that didn't affect the results and predictions of the analysis.
